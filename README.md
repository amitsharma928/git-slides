example slides
==============

Warning! Even though this branch is public,
its git history is likely to get rewritten.

This is because each slide is a git commit, so
editing the slides requires rewriting history!

example
-------

The actual slides are in the git history of the
file "example.sh". Install the vim plugin, open
"example.sh", and follow the on-screen instructions.
